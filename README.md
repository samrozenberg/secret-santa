Secret Santa version that allows authentificated users to create games and assign automatically the participants together.

An authenticated user can create an event (which includes a title, a maximum spending gift amount and a list of participants).

When the event is created, the app randomly assigns each participant together, so that everyone receives a gift.

Once this is done, the app sends an email to each participant to tell them who they should give a gift to.
